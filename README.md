# COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Model

This tool was developed by researchers at Vitalant Research Institute to model COVID-19 Convalescent Plasama collection and distribution to inform policy and operations.

The model has two main components, an agent-based microsimulation used to simulate the donor recruitment and collection process, and a linked production and demand model to project CCP release, distribution and inventory. The model utilizes estimates and projections of COVID-19 patients discharged from hospital supplied by an external epidemic model to create agents that can be recruited as CCP donors. New hospital admissions from the same epidemic model are used to inform the CCP demand model.

## Model structure

The structure of the microsimulation model is shown in the figure below.

The production and demand model applies multipliers to the output of the microsimulation model to project the number of CCP units utilized and stockpiled over time.
